1. Why JWT Came into Existence?
JWT (JSON Web Token) was introduced to address the following issues with traditional authentication and session management systems:

Scalability of Session-Based Authentication:

Traditional session-based authentication stores user sessions on the server side, requiring server memory and leading to scaling issues for large-scale applications.
Stateless Authentication:

JWT enables stateless authentication, where no session data is stored on the server. The client holds all the required information in the token.
Cross-Platform Communication:

JWT is compact and can be easily transmitted between different components (e.g., web, mobile, and backend APIs).
Security for Modern Applications:

Provides secure token-based authentication for APIs, microservices, and distributed architectures.
2. What Does JWT Contain?
JWT consists of three parts:

Header:

Contains metadata about the token, such as:
Type (JWT)
Algorithm used for signing (e.g., HS256, RS256).
Payload:

Contains claims (information about the user or subject).
Example claims:
Registered Claims: sub (subject), iat (issued at), exp (expiration).
Public Claims: Custom claims like role, permissions.
Signature:

Ensures the integrity of the token.
Created using the encoded header, payload, and a secret key (or private key for asymmetric algorithms).
3. How JWT Works?
Authentication Flow:

Login:
Client sends credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication server.
Generate JWT:
Server validates credentials and generates a JWT containing user details and roles.
Send JWT to Client:
The client receives and stores the JWT (e.g., in localStorage or cookies).
Use JWT for Requests:
The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests.
Verify JWT:
The server verifies the JWT's signature and expiration before granting access.
4. How Does JWT Secure Applications?
JWT ensures security through:

Signature Validation:
The server validates the token’s signature to ensure it wasn’t tampered with.
Expiration (exp claim):
JWTs include an expiration time to prevent misuse after a certain period.
Compact and Encoded:
JWT is Base64Url encoded but not encrypted, so sensitive data should not be stored in it.
Algorithm Options:
Symmetric (HS256) and Asymmetric (RS256) signing ensure robust token integrity.
HTTPS:
Using JWT over HTTPS prevents token interception (man-in-the-middle attacks).
5. Comparing OAuth2 and JWT
Feature	OAuth2	JWT
Purpose	Authentication & Authorization	Token format used in OAuth2 or standalone authentication
Statefulness	Can be stateful (uses server-side session)	Stateless (all data in token)
Token Type	Bearer token	Self-contained token
Storage	Server maintains session state	No server storage (stateless)
Security	Highly secure, robust framework	Secure with proper implementation
Complexity	More complex	Simpler to implement
Use Case	Enterprise-level apps	Lightweight APIs and microservices
Pros and Cons of JWT:

Pros	Cons
Stateless and scalable	Cannot be revoked easily
Compact and fast	Larger payload increases size
Cross-platform support	Must use HTTPS for security
No server memory usage	Sensitive data not encrypted
