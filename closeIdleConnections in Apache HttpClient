closeIdleConnections in Apache HttpClient
Definition:
The closeIdleConnections method in Apache HttpClient is used to clean up idle connections in the connection pool. When connections are no longer being used (i.e., they are idle), they can consume resources and eventually lead to performance issues or exhaustion of available connections.

This method ensures that idle connections that have been idle for a specified time period are closed and removed from the pool to free up resources.

Default Value:
There is no default value for closeIdleConnections.
It is a method that you need to explicitly call in your code to manage idle connections.
The connection pool does not automatically close idle connections unless you set this manually.

When It Applies:
The closeIdleConnections method applies whenever you want to manage the idle connections in the pool. By calling this method, you ensure that idle connections are removed after a specified time.

It is generally used in long-running applications or servers where connections can remain idle for extended periods. This cleanup process ensures that unnecessary resources are not held, and the connection pool remains efficient.

Method Usage:
PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager poolingConnManager = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();

// Close idle connections after 30 seconds
poolingConnManager.closeIdleConnections(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
In this example, any connection that has been idle for 30 seconds will be closed and removed from the pool.

Typical Use Case:
In Long-running Applications:

If your application is running for a long time (e.g., a server), idle connections can accumulate in the pool. Over time, this can lead to inefficient resource usage.
Calling closeIdleConnections periodically allows the system to clean up those connections and keep the pool from growing unnecessarily large.
With Limited Resources:

If you're working in an environment with limited resources (e.g., memory or network connections), closing idle connections can help conserve those resources.
For instance, in a microservices architecture, cleaning up idle connections helps avoid resource starvation and keeps performance optimal.
In Periodic Cleanup Tasks:

Often used in combination with scheduled tasks. You might set up a scheduled cleanup task to run at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 or 10 minutes) to ensure idle connections are closed.
High Traffic Systems:

If your system experiences periods of high traffic followed by periods of inactivity, closing idle connections helps to reduce the load on the connection pool and improve responsiveness during traffic surges.
Dynamic Scaling:

If your application scales dynamically, closing idle connections can help reduce the overhead of managing connections in environments with fluctuating load.
Example of Use in a Long-Running Application:
Here’s an example of how you might use closeIdleConnections periodically in a long-running Spring Boot application or any Java service:

// Create connection manager with pooling
PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager poolingConnManager = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();

// Configure maximum connections
poolingConnManager.setMaxTotal(200);
poolingConnManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(20);

// Set idle connection cleanup (close idle connections after 60 seconds)
poolingConnManager.closeIdleConnections(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

// Create the HttpClient
HttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom()
    .setConnectionManager(poolingConnManager)
    .build();
You might want to run closeIdleConnections periodically via a scheduled task in your application:

ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    poolingConnManager.closeIdleConnections(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
}, 0, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES); // Run every 10 minutes
This ensures that idle connections are cleaned up regularly, preventing the pool from growing too large with unused connections.

Summary:
closeIdleConnections is used to clean up idle connections that are no longer needed.
It is not called automatically; it must be invoked manually.
Typical use cases include long-running services, high-traffic applications, or any environment where idle connections may accumulate and waste resources.
It does not have a default value—it must be explicitly configured based on the application’s needs.
